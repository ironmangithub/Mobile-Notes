## systemctl
run systemctl as user: 
systemctl --user start ServaceName.service

## App Center:
Definition: App Center Test (formerly Xamarin Test Cloud) is a test automation service for native and hybrid mobile apps.

Logic: Test runs execute in a hosted fashion: upload the app binary and test files to execute tests in our data center. Generated assets, such as screenshots and device logs, are kept for test reports.

App Center command-line interface: is a unified tool for running App Center services from the command-line.

## Android:
Android Library: move the files into a library module; add the library as a dependency.

APK: Android Package Kit, is the file format for applications used on the Android operating system.

Gradle: an advanced build toolkit.

Android Studio used Gradle to automate and manage the build process, it is controlled by build configurations.

Gradle and Android Studio plugin run independent, can run them independently. 
APK packager: combines the DEX files and compiled resources into an APK or AAB, depending on the chosen build target. 


Build types: define certain properties that Gradle uses when building and packaging your app.
Product flavors: represent different versions of your app that you may release to users, such as free and paid versions of your app.

Build variants: A build variant is a cross product of a build type and product flavor, and is the configuration Gradle uses to build your app. 

Manifest entries: You can specify values for some properties of the manifest file in the build variant configuration. 

Dependencies: The build system manages project dependencies from your local filesystem and from remote repositories. 

Signing: The build system enables you to specify signing settings in the build configuration, and it can automatically sign your app during the build process. 

Code and resource shrinking; The build system enables you to specify a different ProGuard rules file for each build variant.

Multiple APK support: The build system enables you to automatically build different APKs that each contain only the code and resources needed for a specific screen density or Application Binary Interface (ABI).



Project Structure: project -> module -> resource set

settings.gradle: defines project-level repository settings, tells Gradle which modules should be included when building. 


Syncing project with Gradle files: When you make changes to the build configuration files in your project, Android Studio requires that you sync your project files so that it can import your build configuration changes and run some checks to make sure your configuration won't create build errors.


AGP: The Android Gradle plugin.
